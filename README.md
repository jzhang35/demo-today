It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Someimtes you wan tbullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `war example = true`. If you 've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }
    
GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines withot indentation:

```
if (isAwesome){
    return true
}
```

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}

```

```html
<p> this is test </p>
```
